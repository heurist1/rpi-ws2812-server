		<title>WS2812 Server - Master Slave</title>
	</head>
<body>
<p>
With master - slave commands you can connect one WS2812 server instance to multiple Raspberry Pis.
This enables you to connect as many LED strings as you want using multiple Raspberry Pis which are connected by Wifi or Ethernet.
</p>

First on the slave 1 execute these commands:
<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,256,3
init
slave_listen 1, 8000
</code>
</div>

on slave 2 execute the same commands:
<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,512,3
init
do
    slave_listen 1, 8000
loop
</code>
</div>

<p>
slave_listen will now wait for the master to connect to port 8000. 
When the master disconnects the command will end, you can put it in a do ... loop structure to automatically start listening again.
</p>

<p>
On the master Raspberry, this is the Raspberry that will control ALL LED strings and run the main command script.
The master must be able to connect to the slaves by network connection (TCP protocol).
Setup a LED string of 256 LEDs on the master:
</p>

<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,256,100,"192.168.0.2",8000
setup 2,512,100,"192.168.0.3",8000
init
fill 1,FF0000
fill 2,00FF00
render 1
render 2
</code>
</div>

<p>
The master will connect to 192.168.0.2, this is the IP of the slave 1 Raspberry.
The master will connect to 192.168.0.3, this is the IP of the slave 2 Raspberry.
Then the master will fill channel 1 with red color, channel 2 with blue and the render commands will transfer the data to the slave Raspberries.
The slave Raspberry will eventually render it to the LED string.
</p>

<p>
    <b>NOTE:</b> If you want to use 2 channels on the same slave, put the slave_listen in different threads.
