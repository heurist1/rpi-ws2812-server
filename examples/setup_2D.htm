		<title>WS2812 Server - setting up 2D</title>
	</head>
<body>
<p>
Connect a 2D panel with WS2812 LEDs to your Raspberry pi. It's possible to chain many panels together and create a large display.<br/>
First you need to do a normal setup with total LEDs in all connected panels.<br/>
The config_2D command will create a conversion table in the background taking the x and y location and convert it to LED position in the normal 1D string.
There are 4 supported LED configurations and a 5th type which allows you to create your own conversion table in a text file.<br/>
At this moment the first pixel (0,0) must always be at the left top of the screen.

<ul>
<li>Panel type 0:<br/>
	Row by row and the end of each row is connected to the beginning of the next row.<br/>
	<img src="panel_type_0.png"/>
</li>
<li>Panel type 1:<br/>
	Row by row but even rows are connected left to right and odd rows right to left.<br/>
	<img src="panel_type_1.png"/>
</li>
<li>Panel type 2:<br/>
	Panels with LEDs configured as columns.<br/>
	<img src="panel_type_2.png"/>
</li>
<li>Panel type 3:<br/>
	Panels with LEDs configured as columns but odd panel rows are rotated 180°.<br/>
	<img src="panel_type_3.png"/>
</li>
<li>Panel type 4:<br/>
	Custom pixel locations defined in a text file. This text file looks like:<br/>
	<div class="commands">
<code>
x,y=index
0,0=3
1,0=4
2,0=5
3,0=10
4,0=11
5,0=6
</code>
	</div>
	Here x and y is the pixel coordinates and index is the location of the LED at x,y in the 1D string. (Do not include x,y=index in the file.)
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>The following commands configure a 32x16 pixel display with 2 32x8 pixel displays.</p>

<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,512,3
init
brightness 1,32
config_2D 1,32,16,3,32,8
</code>
</div>

<p>
NOTE: You need to compile with ENABLE_2D=1 for 2D commands to work. This also requires additional libraries to be installed.<br/>
If you forgot type:
</p>

<div class="commands">
<code>
make clean
make ENABLE_2D=1
</code>
</div>
