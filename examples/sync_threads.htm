		<title>WS2812 Server - synchronizing threads</title>
	</head>
<body>
<p>
In case you have 2 LED strings and you want both LED strings to execute some effects but they should start / end at the same time. You can do this with threads and at some point synchronize them. <br/>
Add a LED string of 256 LEDs WS2812 chip on PWM0 (GPIO 12) output of the Raspberry Pi.<br/>
Add a LED string of 64 LEDs WS2812 on PWM1 (GPIO 13) output.<br/>
The following commands will fade both LED strings in / out at the same time.
</p>

<div class="commands">
<code>
setup 1,256,3
setup 2,64,3,0,255,19
init
brightness 1, 32
brightness 2, 32
fill 1,00FF00
fill 2,0000FF

thread_start 1
do
   fade 1,0,32,100
   wait_signal
   fade 1,32,0,100
   wait_signal
loop
thread_stop

thread_start 2
do
   fade 2,0,32,100
   signal_thread 1,1
   fade 2,32,0,100
   signal_thread 1,1
loop
thread_stop
</code>
</div>

<p>
The wait_signal in thread 1 will wait until it receives a signal to continue. This signal comes from thread 2 with the signal_thread 1,1 command.
