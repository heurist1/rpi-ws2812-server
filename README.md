# RPI-WS2812-Server
This is a small program for driving the WS281x (a.k.a. [NeoPixel](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/12999)) LEDs from a webserver, command line, text file, Python,... using the Raspberry Pi. It uses the rpi_ws281x PWM driver code from jgarff ([https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)). The LEDs can be controlled by sending text commands to a tcp socket. These commands can be generated by a webserver script, android app,... It's also possible to control the leds directly from the command line or by loading text file containing some predefined color patterns.
Since version 5.0 support for the SK9822 chips which use a clock and data (SPI like interface) was added.
Version 6.0 added support for 2D graphics.

read the change log to see what is new:
[CHANGES.md](https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server/blob/master/CHANGES.md)

# Supported chips
You can use this with the WS2811, WS2812, SK6812, SK9822 chips.

# Installation
On the raspberry you open a terminal window and type following commands:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install gcc make git libjpeg-dev libpng-dev pkg-config
git clone https://github.com/tom-2015/rpi-ws2812-server.git
cd rpi-ws2812-server
make
sudo chmod +x ws2812svr
```

Newer versions require libjpeg-dev and libpng-dev for reading PNG and JPEG images.
If you don't want to use JPEG or PNG you can disable this using:
```
make NO_JPEG=1 NO_PNG=1
```

For 2D support you must compile with ENABLE_2D. This also requires to install the following packages:
With 2D support you can connect multiple LED panels to your Pi and easly render images, graphics, GIFs.
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libcairo2-dev libx11-dev libxcb1-dev libfreetype6-dev
```
make ENABLE_2D=1
```

On newer Raspbian (>=Jessie) operating system the audio output is activated by default, you need to disable this:
You can do this by blacklisting the sound module:
```
echo "blacklist snd_bcm2835" | sudo tee /etc/modprobe.d/snd-blacklist.conf
```

Also in comment out the `audio=on` parameter in `/boot/config.txt`
```
sed "s/^dtparam=audio=on/#dtparam=audio=on/g" /boot/config.txt
```

# Testing
Connect your LEDs to the PWM output of the Raspberry Pi and start the program:
```
sudo ./ws2812svr
```

Now first initialize the driver code from jgarff by typing 'setup'.
On the following line you must **replace 10** by the number of leds you have attached!.
```
setup 1,10
init
```

Now you can type commands to change the color of the leds.
For example make them all red:

```
fill 1,FF0000
render
```

# Examples
You can find examples in the examples folder.

# Available commands
Here is a list of commands you can type or send to the program. All commands have optional comma seperated parameters. The parameters must be in the correct order!

* `init` command must be called everytime the program is started after the setup command, this will initialize resource on the Pi according to the setup command

```
init <frequency>,<dma>

# <frequency> Frequency to use for communication to the LEDs, default 800000
# <dma>       DMA channel number to use, default 10 be careful not to use any channels in use by the system as this may crash your SD card/OS
#             use cat /proc/device-tree/soc/dma@7e007000/brcm,dma-channel-mask to see which channels (bitmask) might be used by the OS
```

* `setup` command must be called everytime the program is started:

Depending on the `<led_type>` the setup command takes different parameters.

```

# For <led_type> values 0-11 (WS2812 and SK6812 chips):

# <invert>             Invert output, default 0
# <global_brightness>  Global brightness level for channel (0-255), default 255
# <gpionum>            GPIO output number, default 18 for more see 'GPIO usage' at this page: [https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x](https://github.com/jgarff/rpi_ws281x)


# For <led_type> values 12-17 (SK9822 chips):

setup <channel>,<led_count>,<led_type>,<invert>,<global_brightness>,<SPI_DEV>,<SPI_SPEED>,<ALT_SPI_PIN>

# <channel>            Channel number
# <led_count>          Number of leds in channel
# <led_type>           Type of led chip WS2811, SK6812, SK9822 or virtual (see below) default 0

99 VIRTUAL LED CHANNEL

When using led_type = 99 this function takes different arguments:
setup <channel>,<led_count>, 99, <parent_channel_number>, <offset>

# <channel>            		Channel number to initialize
# <led_count>		   		Number of leds in the virtual channel
# 99				   		Virutal channel LED type
# <parent_channel_number>	The phyisical channel number previously initialized with the setup command
# <offset>					Start at this LED position in the phyisical LED string

# When using LED type = 99 you can create a virtual LED channel which is a part of a physical LED channel previously setup with one of the other LED types. This enables you to connect all your LEDs together and use the effect commands as if they were connected as sperated strings.

Example: setup 1,10,0

		rotate 1,1,2
		render
		delay 200
	loop
thread_stop
```

* `set_thread_exit_type` This will set if the thread should be aborted when the kill_thread or ini_thread command is executed for the <thread_id> parameter
						 READY + newline (CR + LF) will be returned when the thread has exited.
```
set_thread_exit_type <thread_id>,<type>

# <thread_id>   The thread number  (1-63)
# <type>        Exit type: 0 - aborts current running thread and immediate execute next commands
                           1 - wait until all commands completed, then exit
```

* `wait_thread` wait for a given thread to finish all commands (the exit type is ignored here)
```
wait_thread <thread_id>

# <thread_id>  The thread number (1-63)

```
signal_thread <thread_id>, <wait until thread is waiting for the signal>
# <thread_id>  										The thread number (1-63)
# <wait until thread is waiting for the signal>		Set to 1 to stop and wait until the thread_id reached wait_signal, best is to always put this to 1.

```

* `reset` reset all initialized led strings, ready for new setup commands
```
reset
```

# Special keywords

You can add `do ... loop [times]` to repeat commands.

For example the commands between `do` and `loop` will be executed 10 times:
```
do
	<enter commands here to repeat>
loop 10
```

Endless loops can be made by removing the '10'.
Inside a loop you can use {i} for the loop counter as function argument where i is the loop index (for loop inside loop)

For example {0} will be automatically replace by 0,1,2,3,4:

```
do
	fill 1,FF0000,{0},1
loop 5
render
```

is the same as the C-style code:

```c
for (i=0; i<5; i++) {
	fill 1,FF0000,i,1
}
```

If you have nested loops you can increase the {0} to {1}, {2},...

```
do
	do
		fill 1,FF0000,{1},1
	loop 5
	render
loop
```

Also possible to add a step value for the loop index to fill every "even" led

```
do
	fill 1,FF0000,{0},1
loop 5,2
```

is the same as:

```
for (i=0; i<5; i+=2) {
	fill 1,FF0000,i,1
}
```

To create an alternating pattern of colors use rotate commands in a loop.
For a 300 LED string this will create alternating RED-YELLOW-GREEN-BLUE-PINK colors:
```
do
	rotate 1,1,1,FF0000
	rotate 1,1,1,FFFF00
	rotate 1,1,1,00FF00
	rotate 1,1,1,0000FF
	rotate 1,1,1,FF00FF
loop 60
```

# PHP example
First start the server program:

* `sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp`

Then run the php code from the webserver (check out the internet how to setup a webserver PHP+APACHE or PHP+NGINX on your Pi):

```PHP
// Create a rainbow for 10 leds on channel 1:

send_to_leds("setup 1,10;init;brightness 1,32;");

function send_to_leds ($data) {
	$sock = fsockopen("127.0.0.1", 9999);
	fwrite($sock, $data);
	fclose($sock);
}
```

# Command line parameters

```
# Listens for clients to connect to port 9999 (default).
sudo ./ws2812svr -tcp 9999`

# Loads commands from a text file
sudo ./ws2812svr -f text_file.txt

# Creates a device called /dev/ws281x where you can write you commands to with any other programming language (do-loop not supported here).
sudo ./ws2812svr -p /dev/ws281x

# Initializes with command setup 1,4,5 and command init it
sudo ./ws2812svr -i "setup 1,4,5; init;"

# Loads with settings from a config file
sudo ./ws2812svr -c /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```

# Running as a service
To run as service run make install after compilation and adjust the config file in /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```
make
sudo make install
```

After installing service it will run by default in TCP mode on port 9999, if you want to change this you must edit the config file:
```
sudo nano /etc/ws2812svr.conf
```

Change the mode to:
tcp for TCP mode (change the port= setting)
file for file mode (change the file= setting for location of file)
pipe for named pipe mode (change the pipe= setting for the location of the named pipe)
mode must be first setting in the conf file!
init setting can be used to initialize the led count and type fill color,...
```
mode=tcp
port=9999
file=/home/pi/test.txt
pipe=/dev/leds
init=
```

# Complex animations
If you need to create an complex animation, it is suggested to save color values (each LED 1 pixel) in a png/jpg image file and load this file with the readpng command.
If you have a LED string of 300 LEDs best is to create an image file which is 300 pixels wide and X pixels high.


# 2D LED panel support
Support for multiple 2D connected WS2812 LED panels is added since version 5.3
This requires to compile the code with parameter ENABLE_2D=1
if you didn't compile with 2D support you can do so now:
```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libcairo2-dev libx11-dev libxcb
make clean
make ENABLE_2D=1
sudo make install
```

# 2D graphics support
2D graphics are rendered using cairo (https://www.cairographics.org), first a 1D led string channel must be initialized with total LEDs in your 2D matrix.
Next you call config_2D which will initialize cairo surface / layers and attach them to the 1D led string. After this calling render on the channel will flush the cairo surface to the 1D led string and render it to the leds.
Executing 1D effects on a 2D configured channel will have no effect.

# 2D graphics layers
By default the bottom layer is initialized with a 2D channel but it's possible to initialize more layers and change the layer 2D commands will paint to.
The render command will then paint all layers to the bottom layer / surface and send the result to LEDs.
With this it's possible to for example load a PNG file as background and paint shapes or text on top of it, clear text and paint something else without having to redraw the entire PNG and shapes.


* `config_2D` configure 2D LED matrix (requires compile with ENABLE_2D=1)

```
#NOTE: first call setup and init to configure a 1D led string with total LEDs in the 2D matrix.
#NOTE: origin (x=0,y=0) is always the left top of the 2D matrix.

config_2D <channel>,<width>,<height>,<panel_type>,<panel_size_x>,<panel_size_y>,<start_led>,<map_file>
# <channel>         Channel to configure
# <width>           Number of LEDs in x direction
# <height>			Number of LEDs in y direction
# <panel_type>		If connecting multiple A*B LED panels this defines how LEDs are connected in each panel
# <panel_size_x>	Size in x direction for each LED panel
# <panel_size_y>	Size in y direction for each LED panel
# <start_led>		2D panel starts at this position in the 1D LED string
# <map_file> 		Optional a map file defining each X,Y location and index in the 1D LED string

# panel_type values:

0 row by row and the end of each row is connected to the beginning of the next row
1 row by row but even rows are connected left to right and odd rows right to left
2 panels with LEDs configured as columns
3 panels with individual vertical rows starting left top of each panel row but odd panel rows start from the right top.
4 use the map_file which is a file having a line for each LED defining x,y=LED_INDEX
```
